AI-assisted Product Engineer with 12+ years in startups, gamedev, and e-commerce. I build and launch products from scratch (BE+FE+deploy), solo or in small teams, prioritizing fast execution, minimal bureaucracy, and pragmatic solutions.

I move fast and get things done, writing clean, performant code without over-engineeringâ€”KISS & YAGNI at the core. Quick hacks when needed, solid architecture for core features.

Built AI platforms, job aggregators, HR automation tools, and content discovery services. 
I create fast, scalable, and no-nonsense solutions with intuitive UX/UI and a focus on execution and simplicity

All of my projects are private, but I'm open to share some of them if you're interested.
